# The ruby.org.au repository has moved!

We've moved to the `rubyaustralia` organization:

https://github.com/rubyaustralia/ruby.org.au

Please update your remote tracking branches like this:

```
git remote set-url roro https://github.com/rubyaustralia/ruby.org.au
```

... replacing `roro` with the name of your remote (possibly `origin` if you
were contributing).
